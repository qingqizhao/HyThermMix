# GERG-2008 Equation of State

This repository provides an implementation of the GERG-2008 equation of state in Python. It calculates thermodynamic properties of gas mixtures based on given components and conditions.

## Features

- Calculate thermodynamic properties (P, T, rho, h, s, u, etc.) from specified inputs.
- Supports a variety of components defined in the `src/components` directory.
- Uses `numpy` and `scipy` for mathematical computations and solving nonlinear equations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `numpy`
- `scipy`

### Running the Code
Run an example:
```
python examples/main.py
```
